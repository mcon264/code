    String objects are immutable. Therefore, when executing `result += ch`,
    Java does not add ch to the end of an existing String object. Instead,
    Java creates a new String object, copies all characters from the old
    String object into the new String object, and adds ch at the end.
    Running time of repeat1:
    - in the first pass of the loop, there is 1 step
    - in the second pass, there are two steps.
    - in the third pass, there are three steps
    - and so on.
    - There are n passes in total.
    The total number of steps is approximately 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n.
    1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = (1/2)n^2 + (1/2)n.
    So the running time is O(n^2).

    Executing `sb.append(ch)` does not create a new StringBuilder object.
    Instead, it simply adds ch to the end of the existing StringBuilder.
    Running time of repeat2:
     - the for loop runs n times.
     - Inside the loop, we just call the append method of StringBuilder
     - the append method runs in constant time.
     - The toString() method runs in O(n) time, but only gets called once.
    So the running time of repeat2 is O(n).
