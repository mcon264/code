/*
Bubble sort: make repeated passes, swapping adjacent values when necessary.
The larger values bubble up to the end of the array.

Tracing basic version of bubble sort:
original:     {2, 3, 2, 5, -2, 3, 14, 12}
after pass 1: {2, 2, 3, -2, 3, 5, 12, | 14}
after pass 2: {2, 2, -2, 3, 3, 5, | 12, 14}
after pass 3: {2, -2, 2, 3, 3, | 5, 12, 14}
after pass 4: {-2, 2, 2, 3, | 3, 5, 12, 14}
after pass 5: {-2, 2, 2, | 3, 3, 5, 12, 14} (the optimized version stops here)
after pass 6: {-2, 2, | 2, 3, 3, 5, 12, 14}
after pass 7: {-2, | 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 12, 14}

(After each pass, everything to the right of the bar is in
its final location.)

In the basic version, we always have to perform n - 1 passes
for an array of length n.

We make an optimization: if, on any given pass, we don't perform
any swaps, then the array must already be sorted, and we can stop.

What is the best-case scenario for the input, the case where the amount
of work that has to be performed is as small as possible?

What is the worst-case scenario?
